Because I'm both lazy and uncreative, I'm going to spread one post into two. [Yesterday] ({% post_url 2020-03-05-Thinking-in-Language %}) I wrote about how I don't always think in a language. And I used some purple prose to allude to what I meant, but didnt' really describe it in depth.
Today, while I'm still tired, I will attempt to give more concrete examples. I think that it's ulimately that I am, or was, a very visual person, and that I can picutre my ideas in my head very easily. 

When I was in highschool I was on the robotics team, and at the time I ~~knew~~ thought I wanted to be a mechanical engineer, I like thinking about the way things work, and making them work to solve a certain problem, and as such I was "designing" parts of the mechanical side of the robots. Well "designing" to the best of my 16 year old capabilities. And when I was thinking about the robot, or how to improve it, I'd think about how all the sub-systems would move in conjunction with each other. Actually that sounds like a pretty common thing, I'd imagine most people aren't going to think about something moving objects in terms of anything but the thing moving.

Coding is also similar for me. When I'm thinking about a program, I tend to think about how data (which has a shape) flows through the different code segments. I only find myself thinking about the *names* of things, at least explicitely, when I get confused as to what's happening. But generally in my head, the information moves around without specific labels attached to it. 
In hindsight, this is also probably pretty normal too, but I'm tired and I need a post for today. I guess I've learned I'm Less Special than I'd like to be, so that's a good lesson.
