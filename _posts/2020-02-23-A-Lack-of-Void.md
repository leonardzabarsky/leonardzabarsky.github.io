title: A Lack of Void
---
We all perscribe narratives to our experiences. Sometimes, they can be helpful "I'm a happy person, look at how great my life is.
I have a job that's magnitudes above minimum wage, hobbies I enjoy, and people to hang out with. There's no reason to not be happy".
And sometimes the stories can be unhelpful, "Because I'm happy, there's no reason I should work on making myself happier. 
The status quo is good enough." And to some extent, both stories are true, especially given how they're describing how the teller
feels about the world. But if the teller has some goal in their life, like maximizing happiness, then the second story they tell
themselves doesn't really lend itself said goal. But on the other hand, change is stressful, and if they narrator *also* find that
inducing stress in themselves moves them away from happinesss, how should they reconcile the two points? ~~No don't tell me to read the sequences~~

Now if you're asking yourself, how the fuck does that relate to the title of the post, you'd have a good point. But this is my 
~~diary~~ blog and I get to structure my posts the way I want. Though there is a relation (I promise). I was talking to some 
people today and they mentioned me not having a Goal to work towards as a negative trait of mine. 
Specifically, that I was lacking in [the void](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/). And I don't at all disagree that
I'm not really working towards anything in particular, but I've always thought that at my young age of <recent college grad>, not
having a goal was not only the norm, it's a *good thing*. Like, I've barely existed as an adult, why should I commit to something
that I'm not sure I even like, or care about? And I guess the answer to *that* is that I wont know if I want to commit to something
until I try to, and that I shouldn't be so afraid of failing. The thing is, I haven't always been this way. I used to have a Goal,
it was to Be Better. Better at what? Mostly myself, if I could do 10 pushups last week I better be able to do 12 this week, or if 
I hit 20% LG last month, I swear to god I should be hitting *at least* 25% this month. Or if I got a 97 on a test, I better fucking
get a 99 on the next one, or else what the fuck am I doing with myself. 

And for a long time, that derision towards my self was a perfectly fine way to improve myself. I may have not been *happy* being 
some sort of cretin who couldn't figure out how to [find if a specific sum could be generated from a set of numbers by looking at
each number only once](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), but if I wasn't happy about it I should just Work Harder and then
I'll get there. The issue only came around when I realized that if I was holding myself to such standards, it was perfectly
reasonable for my to expect everyone else around me to hold themselves to the same standard. And to display a fraction of the 
contempt towards them that I directed inwards. Now it sounds silly when I type it out but as an angsty edgelord teenager, it just
Made Sense. And because I'm a talented person, it turned out that if I just sort of coasted, I'd do well enough, not great, not the
best, but well enough that I'd still get attention and compliments about my work. And if I was coasting, well then, the standards I'd
hold myself and everyone else to would be so much lower that there'd be no need for any anger towards them. So All Was Good And Well. 

That's one story I tell myself anyways, that I'm a Chronically Underachieving Genius who only isn't achieving more because I was never able
to work out a specific personality flaw, but It's Fine because I'm still doing Well Enough. There's another story that seeps in around the 
edge of my conciousness though, a less happy story. The other story is that I've never really been gifted, not really. And that all of the 
success I thought I had was just me skewing any slightly above average things I did, and completely ignoring anything anything that wouldn't
paint me as the type of person who was special. And that, in reality, I was just a average person, with average biases, and that I created
the first narrative as a way to comfort myself out of my mediocrity. This was, and still very much is, a much less happy and preferable 
story than the one where I'm Gifted. And at some level, I'm sure both stories are *somewhat* true, I just don't know how much credence to 
assign to either of them. 

Recently though, I realized that there **might** be something off about me if I think that hating myself is the best way for self improvement,
and that I might want to get that looked at. Turns out, I'm depressed, or at least, I can put the right number of boxes so that I can get 
medication while still keeping my agency, because [self-reported tests](https://www.mdcalc.com/phq-9-patient-health-questionnaire-9) 
are *definitely* to be trusted, especially from mentally unwell people[^1] :) Not that this was a particulary surprising result in hindsight,
I was more or less expecting that given my ~~googling~~ intense reseach. But I had always just attributed depression to like, momentary fluxes
in my mood, where I'd feel Really Bad for a month or so, and then I'd go back to feeling normal. But, [and this is very much just speculation on my part]
me just *existing* and wandering through life aimlessly could also be attributed to that. So now that I'm on [Contact me for product placement], we'll
see if that helps at all with my lack of vision. Though realistically I'm probably going to need to work on getting my drive back even without 
my cozy blanket of darkness.

as accurately as I could.
