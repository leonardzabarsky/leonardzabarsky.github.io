Today's my birthday ~~which means that I could end the post here and it'd be ok, right?~~, and because I'm an ~~milquetoast~~ edgy contraian, I think birthdays are dumb. 
I mean, if *you* want to celebrate them, all the power to you, but really, why limit your partying to just one day? And if you're on the more introverted end of the spectrum, then why expose yourself to that at all? (Look I know that's actually not the way introverts work, but I'm tired and again, it's my birthday :P)
And really, no one gives a shit. Like, having people compliment you/wish you happy birthday is something I *think* most people enjoy (and I guess I do too, at some level where I'm not being contrarian), but really most people aren't super cognizant of when your birthday is, I mean I didn't even really realize until I had to check a calendar. 
Maybe people like a *reason* to celebrate, which is fine, even if it does seem a bit strange to me: if you want to hang out with some people, then Just Do It, and if they're not going to make it because it's not some special day then they're kind of a dick. 
I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I really shouldn't have tried to do 30 posts in 30 days, coming up with things is *hard*, man.
Though I did have someone suggest I write about acroyoga, so that's probably on the schedule.
