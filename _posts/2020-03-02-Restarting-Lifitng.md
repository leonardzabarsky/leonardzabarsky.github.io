title: Restarting Lifting
---
You know how you're really scared of trying things because if you try the you'll know that you failed? Oh no, just me? Well that sucks for you, because I'm the one writing this so you're just going to have to put up with it. And *the fear of failure* is so mortifying to me that it's at least the modal reason for me to not do Whatever. But for whatever reason, lifting doesn't really trigger the same reaction in me. Or well, it might, but I still progress on my lifts so I'm not terribly worried about it. Or at least, that holds while I'm in the swing of things, following the spreadsheet, and picking up heavy things and putting them back down. But whenever I have to take a break (usually cause I was dumb and hurt myself), getting back into it is really hard. Because Honest-to-God I'll be weaker, there's no way to get around it. And being weak sucks. So if I go to the gym and try to lift, I wont be able to do as much, which is more or less *entirely congruent* to failure, so I don't want to go and be weak. And because of that, I get even weaker, because the way to not be weak is to go to the gym (surprise). So today I went, and was weak, and it was terrible. But hopefully that will not be the case for long.
