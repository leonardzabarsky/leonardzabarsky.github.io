title: On Commitments
---
I regret committing to writing these posts. More specifically, I regret making myself accountable
to writing 30 posts in 30 days to a bunch of people. And while it'd be fairly costly for me to 
abandon my goal, it'd go towards a good cause so I'm not terrible concerned about the cost to my
finances. I'm not even sure it's that I'd be upset over not being able to keep my promisses, though that is definetely part of it. It's more that if I miss a day *soon*, I'll not have incentive to keep writing and while there would be other commitment structures (X dollars per Y days missed), I feel like that would be shifting the goals posts. So I'll do my best to trudge 
on, even if that means there's a lot of low quality posts like this one.

Actually, I think that my apprehention about writing new things is because of that. Not that I'm
... ashamed of 'publishing' bad work, it's more that I'm worried I can't write *well*. Like, I've been thinking about what to write about, and there hasn't been anything good. I guess that's part of the learnign process. But how long do I need, to keep at it before I get good? Three months? A year? Multiple years? Maybe I just don't have The Talent for it, whatever the "it" is here. And I guess that's the scary part about actually trying things.
