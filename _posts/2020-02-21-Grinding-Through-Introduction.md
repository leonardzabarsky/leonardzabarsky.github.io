title: Grinding Through Introductions
---
I've never been good at introductions. I'm actually pretty terrible at them. So terrible in fact that my first blog post wasn't even one!
And with a blog post, I don't even have to *interact* with you. Though I guess that's never really been the problem for me. 
I'm more than happy to blather on about topics I find interesting, or listen to people do the same. It's the small talk
that's always gotten to me. No, *Janice* I don't care about how your weekend went, and yes, it has been a criminally warm winter.
Ah well, talk to you again next Monday. And the thing is, I'm very aware that this problem is entirely on me. I mean, everyone else seems to be able to chit chat away
about seemingly banal topics, so why shouldn't I? 

Actually that's one of the reasons I wanted to make this blog, to get better at talking, or at least better at developing ideas.
I don't think this is in anyway a proper substitute for actually talking to people, but that's scary and this can be done at home
where it's nice and comfy so here we are. If I were starter and more motivated I'd think of someway to test the efficacy of
writing skills with conversational skills, but I feel like there's a pretty obvious correlation. Maybe I'll write something about
my feelings on the matter because that's pretty much equivalent to a poorly done study, right? I have more hope that about improving
at developing and fleshing out ideas though. Given that currently I see myself as far too irony poisoned to have non-ironic opinions,
especially about Important Issues. Though I'd have to do research for that so that's something for the future. 

Speaking of blog topics, I have no idea what I'm going to write about. I feel like this and my previous post are both pretty similar,
not that I want to have this become my diary. So for the next 28 days I'll try to write about different things, and see what I like, 
and I guess what I end up being happy (or at least less unhappy) with. Maybe it will end up like a diary, though maybe I'm Missing
The Point with having a very public and archived diary. Oh well, what's the worst that could happen by blogging my inner thoughts
under my full name ;)
