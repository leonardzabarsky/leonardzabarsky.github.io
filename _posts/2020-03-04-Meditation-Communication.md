title: Meditation-Communication

Language is a wonderful, beautiful, powerful creation. With it, we've spread across the globe, wrote some cool books, traveled to the moon, and figured out some problems are [really damn hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness). 
The entirety of our communication is *through* language, it's pretty crazy, that we can take some squiggles, say they repersent specific throat gurgles, and that sequences of *those* repersent whatever is flying through our heads. And it's pretty effective too, most of everyday communication goes by without a hitch. Ok, maybe "most" is kind of stretching it, but we clearly get by, given *gestures broadly at s o c i e t y*. 

But the further out we get from everyday use, the harder it gets to communicate. I mean, a lot of accademicese is really just English in name only, and us lay folk would have a hard time to fully comprehend the denser papers. And a large part of that is us not knowing the private language (jargon) that those strange creatures known as accademics use. But as I've wrote about before, most sub-cultures develop their own set of jargon, and the larger and more obscure the jargon gets, the harder it becomes to penetrate those sub-cultures. 

Now, back to the title ~~I'll get better at these transitions at some point~~. Some of my friends are having a meditation/conciousness study group, and I think the topic is pretty interesting so I went and checked it out. I've done a reasonable amount of yoga and otherwise think I'm reasonably comfortable in my own body/head. But, I really don't have the language to describe me subjective experiences of "zen" or however you want to put it. And it's *really* frustrating. Because I think how our mind works is fascinating to talk about, but it's like ... they're too complicated for language. At least the language I know.
And while there are sub-cultures who have done the ground working of developing jargon already, I find a lot of it entirely too woo-y, and have some revulsion against using it.

Though I guess that's just on me, and I should reclaim "woo-y" language in the name of the nerdy-types.
