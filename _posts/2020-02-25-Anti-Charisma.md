title: Anti-Charisma
---
We've all met charismatic people, people who can seemingly float through any conversation with ease.
People who, from our external perspective have never been flustered, or stumble their words. People who,
for all intents and purposes seem to enjoy conversations with even us asocial nerds? And as envious as
I am of these charasmatic people and their mysterious grasp of social dynamics, there's another group
I'm even more jealous of and perplexed by. It's a group of people who can flow through conversations with
the same fluidity as the stereotypically charasmatic, but they go about it through entirely opposite means.
They go manage ~~despite~~ with all of the social ticks of a asocial nerd, all of *my* social ticks. 
Needless to say, most of this skill probably stems from being comforatable with themselves, but that seems hard.

~~Look I know what I'm talking about are nerdy people who just happen to be charasmatic but I couldn't come up
with anything better for today :(~~
