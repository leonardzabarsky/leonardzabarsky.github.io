title: Names as Pointers
---
For a long time I was *terrible* with names. And I just accepted it, I'm an awkward nerd, and everyone
knows that awkards nerds are bad with names. So for many years I'd just blunder around, going for months
re-introducing myself constantly. Though in all honesty, all of the social gaffs I make as an awkward
nerd, being not great with names was definitely among the lesser. Much less offensive, at least in my 
perception, that *remembering too much*. "Yes of course, we've met 3 times prior, you are the middle child
and have two sisters, one of whom plays soccer and the other is a med student. You are doing a computer
science degree with a focus on cyber security, and are very excited about your internship this summer. 
So now that all the the pleasantries are out of the way, let's get to the interesting things, like what
is your name again?" 

This went on for a while, until I realized that there wasn't really any reason for my detail memory to be
pretty good for everything but names. And just like that, I didn't have to ask people 15 times what their
names are. Usually anyways. While the whole thing was a bit mysterious and perplexing to me, I'm fairly 
certain that I am good at remembering random trivia because I find it interesting, whereas names are more
or less common place. And it's not like I didn't know *who* the person was, I just didn't have a label for them.
So my attempts at trying to figure out if I knew the same person as who I was talking to would more or less
involve me flailing around "well uhhh... he's white... and uhhh... brow-no red-no dirty blond hair, and a beard...
or did he shave" which was a terrible idea for what I feel are obvious reasons. 

The thing is, "he's studying cyber security" isn't particulary interesting either, but it *points* to the more
intersting (at least to me) concept of "shared interests that we can talk about", or at least they're things
that stand out. Now what to *do* with the knowledge that we have shared interests and can have a conversation
about them, I'm still working on that one. But a name is really just a less descriptive way to refer to a person,
which is only really needed if you talk to *multiple* people, and again I was an awkard nerd. There's also some
silliness about people caring and feeling good if you remember and use their name's but that smells kind of bunk.
The thing is *people as a whole* are generally pretty interesting, so if it's possible to tie the large concept
of a person to a short handle like a name, it should be pretty easy to remmeber names right?

Turns out we already do this. Or something so similar enough to be nearly identical anyways. All of the groups
I've been a part of have developed lot's of jargon, simple phrases and words to condense shared language for 
the sake of brevity. Or stupid in-jokes, where all you need is the punchline to resurect the whole joke. 
Actually, I'd say that applies *more* generally to all language, but I'm getting tired and I said a post per day
so maybe some other time ;)
