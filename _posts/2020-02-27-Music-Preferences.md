title: Music Preferences
---
Once upon a time, a young and naive lad was trying to make friends at camp. Like all kids, he
tried to make friends by impressing his peers. In this case, young Lenny wanted to show off
some sick beats he had heard on the radio[^1]. Poor Lenny was a very innocent boy, and had 
managed to escape from the darkests terror a kid can experience: bullying. Up until now that 
is. For inscrutable kid reasons, which are definitely *just* that, and not related to any real
social *ahem* strangness Lenny might have, The Other Kids decided that Lenny's music choice
wasn't up to snuff. The strangest thing was, Lenny knew that bullying was a thing, and wasn't
particulary surprised it was happening to *him*, Big People kept telling him how much of a
problem bullying was, and that it happened to everyone. There was much discourse about How To
Get Over bullying, about how *they* were actually the weak and sad one, etc. But either that 
advice was so powerful that it immediately effected Lenny, or it was so useless that it didn't 
have any perceivable effect, because Lenny definitely didn't *apply* any of it. But Lenny was 
fine, at least for a kid. He may have not made any new friends, but he still had his friend, 
and that was Good Enough.

Now you might be asking yourself, if Lenny didn't give a shit about getting bullied, why are
you writing about this, so many years later? That's a very astute question, and honestly, it
*obviously* did effect Lenny, else why would he be writing about it. But it wasn't so much 
getting traumatised from the meanness that left a mark, it was more *how* he was bullied. 
Poor Lenny was ostracized for liking music that *came out last year*. Now, in hindsight, as I'm
writing this it's pretty obviously just that the other kids were latching onto *something* to
use. But until, uhhh, 30 seconds ago, this had been one of the more perplexing issues Lenny had
faced: Do ~~people~~normies really care about how modern your music taste is? How old can music 
be before it gets uncouth? Lenny had so many questions about this, he just *didn't get* the 
other kids. And as a result, he was always very cagey about his music preferences. "Man, I don't
get other people at all. So I'll keep my happy sounds to my self, and you can have yours". Now, 
at some point Lenny will grow up and get comfortable unironically sharing his music preferences,
but that's more or less up in the air. And until that happens, he'll just go about, listening to
his own music, but no, he doesn't want to share.
