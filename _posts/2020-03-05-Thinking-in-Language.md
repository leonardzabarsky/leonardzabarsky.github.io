title: Thinking in Language
---
I spend a lot of time thinking about communication, probably because I'm not so great at it. As big of an excuse as it sounds like, I didn't interact with many people growing up, so I sort of got socialized by television and books. Or maybe because I thought I should use conversations from books and TV as a model for my real life conversations, so I was bad at them and didn't have many friends. Man, figuring out causation is hard.

Not to say that I think the *only* reason that I'm think my communication skills are lacking is due to me reading too much. I have trouble pronouncing some sounds, I'm bad at reading body language, and I have trouble putting my thoughts into words.
And while it's sometimes like, I have some of the words I need to explain what's going on in my head, I just need to stitch them together, a lot of the time I just don't have any way to begin to communicate what's going on in my head. I just think about the scrabble of emotions and *direction* that's flying around, and want to gesture at some part and go "There, that's what I mean". But, obviously, I can't do that, so instead, I need to figure out some words that can begin to approximate the control-flow of emotions, lights, and shapes that goes through my head. 

[Actually I want to keep writing about this but I'm tired]
