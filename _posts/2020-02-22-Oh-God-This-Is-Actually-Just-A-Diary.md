title: I was hoping I was joking about the diary thing
---
I mean, I'd really hope I'm capable of writing unprompted about something that isn't my life or the thoughts in my head. 
I mean how much of a bummer would it be if I wasn't? Wasn't that the point of all of those essays in school, to develop
my ability to develop a cohesive train of thought. Maybe they existed more to ~~give me busy work~~ teach me time management. 
Or maybe being able to write not from my System 1 is what's actually *hard*. Well there's some quote about the only, things, worth
doing are the hard things, but I'm not sure that's right. Lot's of things are easy, at least once you've become accustomed to them.
Stopping drinking soda (mostly) wasn't easy at first, but now it's just the default and I have to devote very little will power for
it. Thought I guess change being hard shouldn't be a surprise to me, given that my S1 can handle the day-to-day living more or less,
and so "I" am not super cognizant of it. Really, I think that's a better way to think about the things worth doing, or at least the
what you should seek out. Getting your S2 to wake up and actually *do* things is something that's difficult, at least for me. Even
if the same S2 (or at least the "I" writing this) is extremely cognizant that doing new things is not only fun (most of the time), 
it's likely a net benefit to me overall, in the improving my heuristics. Not that *knowing* I should stop being lazy makes doing so
any easier. 

If you haven't been able to tell, I was busy today and didn't get around to coming up with any better ideas for what to blog about.
But commitments are commitments and breaking one 2 days in seems really lame so you're getting this. Actually it'd probably be a 
good idea for me to come up with ideas to write about, and make flesh them out in more than the 30 minutes I spend writing these. 
 * Does group exercise actually work?
 * Names are just vague pointers to things, and we should stop fussing
 * I'm terrified of talking about my music preferences and this is terrible
 * Addendum, the "warm and fuzzies" make me feel incredibly uncomfortable
 * Man growing up and losing interest in videos games *sucks*
 * and more to come (hopefully)...
 But really it's probably going to be a lot more diary posts :_(
