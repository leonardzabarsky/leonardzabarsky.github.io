title: Oh Man Im Sick
---
Oh god I'm kind of sick. I don't *think* it's covid, cause no fever/pnuemonia, but still being immunocompromised right now does not seem ideal. Though I'm working from home for the foreseeable future so I'm not terribly worried. But it does mean I kind of can't be asked to write more currently. 

For better or worse I don't get sick very often, so whenver I do I freak out since I'm not used to it. So I always get super mopey because it's Litteraly The End Of The World. Though I guess oddly enough I am (or was) used enough to depression for it to not be a big deal day-to-day. 
Though really I'm going to bed now.
