title: Finding Hobbies
---
And now for the latest edition of "Leonard ran ouf ideas"...

It's kind of hard to find hobbies. Like, you have to *go and try them*. It's real scary, meeting new people is weird, learning communities norms can be a challenge. *AND* you're likely going to be apprehensive about doing new things, being bad at new things, being bad at new things in front of new people...
I'm not sure what point I'm trying to make here, maybe I wanted to write about how it's hard for *me* to find new hobbies, because I'm an awkward nerd, and making friends is hard. 
Or maybe it's *becacuse* I've gotten some new hobbies recently, and I want to humble brag. It's probably that. I'm a conceited little prick :)
