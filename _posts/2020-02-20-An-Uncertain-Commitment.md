title: So it's better to start off poorly than not at all, right?
---
So I have an issue, a lot of the times I *really* want to do something. 
I want to do it so badly that I end up fantasizing about it, and that ends up
being enough of a reward for me to not actually go through with whatever I 
*really* wanted to do. The latest in my long line of Great Ideas That Are Too
Great is wanting to start a blog. It seems like a good idea. I have good ideas, 
and other people should know about them. The issue is, getting my good ideas
out there is a lot of work, I have to make accounts, and set up a blog, and 
then, probably most strenuous of all, I actually have to *write*.

But I've set up the accounts, I've set up the blog, and I'm even writing 
*right now*! It might have taken me too long, I might have gotten
distracted by the wonderful and terrible and awesome-in-the-literal-meaning-of
-the-word internet. I might be writing this in a cmd window because I couldn't 
figure out how to get a gui editor to access files in WSL (If you know how to
do this, please contact me). But I want to be a better writer, and you deserver
to hear my good ideas, so I suffered through it. For you. And even if I'm not 
happy with how I got to this point, or even where this point is, I'm happy that
I'm here, doing something.

This is going to be a shitty post, it's not going to get edited. But it's going
to be a post, hopefully the first of many. I'd really like to write a post
everyday for the next 30 days, I know [Jacob Falkovich](https://putanumonit.com/2019/12/30/100-ways-to-live-better)
says to do it for 3 months, and maybe I'll make it that far. But for now,
for me, one month will be enough. Because I want to regain control of
myself, and to learn to channel my dreams into productivty.

This is a shitty, awful, crappy post, I haven't even introduced myself
for fucks sake, but I'm going to post it, and I'll write another terrible post
tomorrow, and the day after, and maybe after some time, not 30 days, not 90 days,
but eventually, I'll be able to look at them and be proud of them. OR at least I
hope so. And even if I can never be proud of my own work, maybe having such a low
starting point will give me more room for improvement.
