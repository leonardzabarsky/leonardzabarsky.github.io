I used to be a really hardcore gamer. Back when I was really going at it, I'd play for 6 hours a day easily. And I was really competitive, if there wasn't some sort of ladder or ranking system in the game, I wasn't interested in it. 
And as edge-lord tryhard gamer teen, I was contractually obligated to be really ragey. Like, I'm putting 110% into this video game, how dare you do *anything* less.

And it took me a long time to understand that people could have other mindsets. Actually I'm not sure I've really internalized that fully still. At least in my head, people who don't try in games seem to not try ever. And while I get *now* that people don't always need to go hard all the time ~~I'm totally not guilty of this myself~~, I have an issue understanding people who don't try *ever*

I'm writing this because one of the games I play has a tournament comming up soon, so I've been on the grind. And it's a small enough game that people of all skill levels really need to play with each other, so I'm talking/playing with the very bottom tier of players fairly frequently. And when I talk to them, they just seem to ... not care, about anything. Or at least, they're not trying at anything. They have jobs they don't like, but aren't looking to change. They aren't great at the game, but don't seem to mind. They're lonely, but aren't doing anything about it. etc. 

As I was writing this, it occured to me that they could be playing games as an escape from everything else, or as a way to pass the time. And they don't have The Drive I do that makes it hard to have fun if you're not doing well. I realize that I might come across as comtemptuous, and while they're not my favorite people to play or talk to, I don't harbor any ill will towards them, I'm just more ... confused by them.
