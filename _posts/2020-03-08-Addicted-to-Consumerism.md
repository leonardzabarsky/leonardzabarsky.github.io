title: Addicted to Consumerism
---
I think I have an addiction. The reward loop is just so satsifying, and it's way to easy for me to justify it. And *it's just so easy* for me to continue doing it. Getting amazon packages delivered is just so god-damn satisfying. And the stuff is cheap, I'm in a fortunate enough position that I can buy $15 things once a week and not really have to worry about it. Even if it does add up over the year. But the thing is, I don't *need* any of it, like, did I *really* need a pulseoximeter? Probably not. But covid-19 is scary, and that's a cheap thing to buy, so I did. Or an SD card reader that I can use with my phone, why would I ever need that? But they're cheap, and it makes me feel good to buy them so I do. Really though, it's probably just fine if I can afford it and it makes me happy short term. Even if it might be terrible for the enviroment, and supporting the corpocracy.
