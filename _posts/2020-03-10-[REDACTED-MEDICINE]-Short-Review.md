title: REDACTED MEDICINE Short Review
---
I had mentioned previously that I started taking some SSRI's. And after [Some Number of Days] I figured I might as well talk about how I perceive them. 
So most importantly, I guess they're working I have less/no Dark Thoughts now, which is a big plus. And I guess I feel ... happier? I'm really not sure about this and I don't have a good way to track my mood. I've tried mood trackers but they feel too subjective, and doing it on a daily timeframe seems wrong, I think it should be more fine-tuned if anything.
I am definitely less mopey though, which while not *exactly* the same thing as being happy/achieving happiness is a big enough step that I'm satisfied with it. 
Though the medicine does seem to ware off at the end of the day, so maybe upping the dose would ba good idea. On the other hand, It does make me wake up *slightly* earlier than normal, which I was told was a potential side effect, and that if it happened I should start taking it in the mornings. But I think it's a good effect, and the one time I tried taking it in the morning (forgot the night previous), I was pretty nausious the next day, so I'll avoid that. 
On the sleep effects though, the first night I took it I had a lucid dream, but that hasn't repeated unfortunately. 

I think the most interesting part of this whole thing is that the underlying stressors are still *there*. I still know about them, and am vaguely upset by them, but they just have no where near the impact that they used to. 
From what I've been told this is similar to the way painkillers work for Actual Physical Pain, which is probably more surpising than it should be.
