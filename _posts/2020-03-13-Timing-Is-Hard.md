title: Timing Is Hard
---
~~being sick really sucks~~

Timing things correctly, or I guess more accurately, being decisive is pretty fucking hard. Like, I was *pretty* sure I should have bought some groceries a week or two ago, at least I *think* I was pretty sure.
Unfortunately as it happens, I did not stock up several weeks ago, and instead I was in a rush yesterday, and managed to not get any rice (lots of eggs though). I guess I should have predicted the NBA cancelling.
Or you can be too early, like when I bought some ETFs this week. ~~man some lessons are *expensive*~~

Alternatively, being *decisive* is really important in video games. It's probably ... 80% of being a Good But Not Great player.
The suboptimal play made at the right time is way better than the optimal play made late. Cause you were *there*. 

~~Have I mentioned I'm sick?~~
