Two days ago I talked about how I got bullied as a kid. And more specifically, I was bullied because I didn't like the Approved Music. And while I claimed that this Totally Didn't Effect Me At All, I am still writing two (2) blog posts about it however many years later so maybe it did, a bit. 
And I swear to god I'll get around to it, but I'm being really lazy with when I start writing these, and I'd rather not stay up to 4am writing, so you're getting another diary entry. I mean I guess they're all sort of diary entries, just some are longer ~~and therefor more insightful~~ than others. I've always though I've had "grit" because I'm willing to stick with  my time commitment goals (I will go on a run every week, I will apply to 20 jobs today, etc), but I'm never very happy with my results. I mean in hindsight, I do get benefits from sticking through my promises, and "grit" sort of implies *not* wanting to do said thing, but I feel like part of it is, or at least be, *gritting* your teeth. And if you haven't been able to tell, I'm not very good at that part. Actually, I don't think I'm particularly good at in general but I can do it, which I guess is important. 

Maybe the biggest thing I'll get out of this is getting better at writing while tired (and hopefully spellchecking too :D)
